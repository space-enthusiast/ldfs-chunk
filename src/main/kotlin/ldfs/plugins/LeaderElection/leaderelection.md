### Leader Election Process in the Code

1. **Node Initialization**:
    - Each node starts in the `FOLLOWER` state.
    - A timer (`electionTimer`) is set with a random timeout between 150ms and 300ms to reduce the likelihood of split votes.

2. **Election Timeout**:
    - When a follower node's election timer expires (`onElectionTimeout`), it transitions to the `CANDIDATE` state and starts a new election.
    - The node increments its term, votes for itself, and sends `RequestVote` messages to all other nodes (`peers`).

3. **Vote Request**:
    - Each `RequestVote` message includes the node's term, candidate ID, last log index, and last log term.
    - Peers respond with a `VoteResponse` indicating whether they grant their vote.

4. **Vote Response Handling**:
    - If a node receives a majority of votes, it becomes the leader (`becomeLeader`).
    - If a candidate receives a `VoteResponse` with a term greater than its own, it reverts to the `FOLLOWER` state.
    - If the candidate receives enough votes to reach a majority (`votesReceived > peers.size / 2`), it transitions to the `LEADER` state and starts sending `AppendEntries` messages to maintain its leadership.

5. **Leader Operation**:
    - Once a node becomes the leader, it periodically sends `AppendEntries` messages to all peers to maintain authority and replicate log entries.

### Proof of Correctness

The correctness of this leader election process is derived from the Raft consensus algorithm, which ensures the following properties:

1. **Leader Election Safety**:
    - At most one leader can be elected in a given term.
    - This is ensured by the majority vote requirement and the incrementing term number which prevents split-brain scenarios.

2. **Log Matching**:
    - If two logs contain an entry with the same index and term, then the logs are identical in all preceding entries.
    - This is ensured by including the term and log index in the `RequestVote` and `AppendEntries` messages.

3. **Leader Completeness**:
    - A leader has all committed entries from previous terms.
    - This is ensured by the followers' acceptance of log entries only if they have not missed any previous entries.

### Summary

- The leader election process in the provided code implements a simplified version of the Raft leader election.
- Nodes transition from `FOLLOWER` to `CANDIDATE` and then to `LEADER` based on a random election timeout and majority vote.
- The correctness of the algorithm is rooted in the principles of the Raft consensus algorithm, ensuring leader election safety, log matching, and leader completeness.
- References to the original Raft paper and educational resources provide in-depth explanations and proofs of these properties.
